# Enershare (MVP2 readme)
ENERSHARE scope and objectives are considered to cover three core cornerstones. Trust and sovereignty of data, interoperability of data and participants, and the business logic/applications consist the set of these three concepts that ENERSHARE aims to focus on. Besides ENERSHARE is closely related on and influenced by the IDS reference architecture for International Data Spaces which introduces a benchmark for developing data-driven products, ecosystems, and services, providing a standardized framework for implementation and development. A data space consists of a network of parties and components. In the International Data Spaces Reference Architecture Model (IDS-RAM) this network is formed by connectors. In other words, each component or service in a data space is represented by a connector. An IDS connector allows and enables the exchange of data within a data space. It provides a number of core functions that are extended with business logic inside a data app. Among the Connector Core Service(s) are the means for Authentication, Contract Negotiation and Trusted Data Exchange. 

This documentation refers in the particular components of MVP2.0.
